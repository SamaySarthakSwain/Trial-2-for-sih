## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark, muted blue (#3498db) to convey trust and safety.  Darker values are often used to give interfaces a calm, reliable, and trustworthy vibe.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#2c3e50), for a sophisticated look and comfortable contrast.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#e67e22) for alerts, calls to action, and to draw attention.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. This is a crisp, modern pairing that's suitable for use in automotive and safety contexts.
- Use outlined icons, with a weight that matches the fonts, to give a feeling of crisp precision
- Dashboard layout with a clear separation of modules: driver profile, real-time vehicle speed, collision alerts, live map with route suggestion, and emergency status reporting. Prioritize critical data with prominent placement.
- Subtle animations for alert notifications and status changes to provide intuitive feedback.
